# Ember Touch

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/emberjs-addons/ember-touch.png)](http://travis-ci.org/emberjs-addons/ember-touch)

Ember Touch lays the groundwork for a comprehensive touch and gesture system that sits on top of [EmberJS](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js).

This project is currently unmaintained because most of its features has been ported to [HammerJS](http://hammerjs.github.io/).

Check [HammerJS](http://hammerjs.github.io/) if you need a solid library to create and coordinate touch gestures.
